A container that allows child elements to present a honeycomb layout.

# Honeycomb layout
Other elements will start from the first element and wrap around:

```
         ●       ●
        (7)     (8)
     ●       ●       ●
    (6)     (1)     (9)
 ●       ●       ●       ...
(5)     (0)     (2)
     ●       ●       ...
    (4)     (3)
```
